# CSci 560: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Materials developed for [East Texas A&M University](http://tamuc.edu)
course CSci 560: Neural Networks and Deep Learning.  These materials
were initially developed in the Spring of 2019 and 2020 semester.
Major reorganization done Summer 2025.


# Getting Started

The main content of the course will be delivered as interactive iPython/Jupyter notebooks.
These notebooks can be found in the `notebooks` subriectory of the offical class `nndl`
repository.  

In addition, there will be daily/weekly assigned readings from the required course
textbook (see below).  All assignments and evaluations for the course will come mainly from
our required textbook examples and readings.

# Class Resources

## Suggested material for learning python:

- [Think Python: How to think like a computer scientist](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/) free online textbook, very good resource for not only Python but learning to program in general.
- [Google Developers Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) short course with videos, might be helpful for those looking for video tutorials of Python.
- [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/lessons/index.html) has 2 separate courses "Programming with Python" and "Plotting and programming with Python".  Both are excellent, and have exercises and notebooks to use.

## Course  Textbooks on Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Machine Learning:

- Francois Chollet (2021). 
[Deep Learning with Python (Second Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Deep-Learning-Python-Second/dp/B09RN7QLT3/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&sr=1-1)
Manning. This is our required textbook. Make sure that you get and use the most recent 2nd edition of this text.
- Stevens, Antiga, Viehmann (2021). 
[Deep Learning with PyTorch: Build, Train, and Tune Neural Networks Using Python Tools](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-PyTorch-Neural-Networks/dp/B097R3TBLR/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&sr=1-1)
Manning.  If interested in a good book on the `PyTorch` library, though we are using Kearas in the course
for assignments and lectures.
- Aurelian Geron
(2022). [Hands-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1098125975/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&sr=1-1).
O'Reilly Media.  We use this text in our Graduate Machine Learning class, but only the first half of it up till neural networks and `TensorFlow` material.  We will use as additional reading for this class.
