# Course Mathematical Concept Review Materials

Our class may assume at least a basic familiarity with several
topics that are fundamental to a deeper understanding of 
machine learning and neural networks.  These include:

- Calculus: especially integrals and derivatives
- Probability and Statics: including fundamental counting / combinations from probability, and some familarity with probability
  distributsion, such as uniform, Normal and Poisson distributions.
- Linear Algebra: familiarity with representing matrices/tensors and basic manipulations using them to translate and rotate coordinate systems.
