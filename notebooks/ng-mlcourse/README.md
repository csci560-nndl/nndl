# Dr. Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course Lecture Video Companion Notebooks

This subdirectory contains several companion iPython/Jupyter notebooks created by me
that implement some of the examples and discussion sfrom Dr. Ng well known Machine Learning
course.  You can find a YouTube playlist of the full course following:

- [Machine Learning by Professor Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiPvV5TNogxIS4bHQVW4pMkj4CHA8COdX)


This course was redone as a paid Courserea course, but this version is still a very
well done introduction to the basics concepts of machine learning, and I recommend
it as a companion course for my Machine Learning and Deep Learning students.  If
the links in the notebooks are not working, the above link to the full playlist
should have all of the lectures for the companion notebooks here.  Dr. Ng uses
matlab/octave in his course lectures, so I have converted a lot of the
examples to equivalent Python / Scikit-Learn examples for you here.
