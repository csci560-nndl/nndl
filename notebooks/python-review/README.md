# Python Lecture / Review Notabooks

Our class may not have any specific time or lectures set aside for learning
the basics of Python.  I usually expect students for our Machine Learning
and Deep Learning classes to be familiar with basic Python, or at least to
have enough experience in other languages to pick up what you need to
know of Python yourself for the course.  Our class textbook and libraries
assume an understanding of using Python.

However, you can find in this subdirectory several notebooks related to
using Python, and using the important scientific libraries you should
be (or become) familiar with for this class.  This includes materials
on `Matplotlib` for plotting and visualization, `Pandas` for data
frames and basic data analytics tasks, and `NumPy` for representing
vectors, matrices and tensors and manipulating them in Python.
