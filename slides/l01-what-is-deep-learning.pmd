# Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI

::: columns

::: {.column width=50%}

- **Artificial Intelligence** (AI): *the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performmed by humans*
- **Machine Learning** (ML): *machine looks at input and answer and figures out the rules*
- **Deep Learning** (DL, DNN): *learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations*
- **Generative AI** (GenAI): *extend from reactive to creative activities*

# Machine Learning: Learning Rules and Representations from Data

::: columns

::: {.column width=50%}

- Usually have human programmer write down rules (a computer program) that turns input into approproate answers.
- In ML paradigm, you give a ML algorithm the input and answers, and it "learns" the rules.
